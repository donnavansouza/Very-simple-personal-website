# Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website! This site was created using only HTML and CSS as a way for me to experiment with and explore the capabilities of CSS. 

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project was to play around with CSS and enhance my skills in web design. I wanted to see how far I could push the boundaries of what can be achieved with just HTML and CSS, without relying on any frameworks or JavaScript.

## Features

- **Clean Layout**: I focused on creating a clean and simple layout to ensure the content is easy to read and navigate.
- **CSS Animations**: I've included some subtle CSS animations to add a bit of flair to the site.
- **Custom Fonts and Colors**: Experimented with different fonts and color schemes to find a visually appealing combination.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structured the content and layout of the website.
- **CSS**: Styled the website, including layout, colors, fonts, and animations.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I have gained a deeper understanding of:

- CSS Flexbox and Grid for layout design
- CSS animations and transitions
- Effective use of fonts and colors

## Future Improvements

- Adding more interactive elements using JavaScript
- Further refining the design based on feedback
- Experimenting with more advanced CSS features
